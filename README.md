# Malayalam-Gender-Classification

We use Malayalam name dataset to Classify Gender of Individuals using their name using Machine Learning. In Malayalam, there is'nt any dataset for this task, so we need to prepare the data before training the model. However I have made a baseline code using a very small dataset which I have created manually.

## How it Works ?

This is basically a Text Classification task in Malayalam. According to [huggingface documentation](https://huggingface.co/tasks/text-classification):

     Text Classification is the task of assigning a label or class to a given text. Some use cases 
     are sentiment analysis, natural language inference, and assessing grammatical correctness.
